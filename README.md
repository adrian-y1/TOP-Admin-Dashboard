# Admin Dashboard Template

**Live site:** [Admin Dashboard](https://adrian-y1.github.io/TOP-Admin-Dashboard/)

This Admin Dashboard template is the final project of [The Odin Project's Intermediate HTML & CSS Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/intermediate-html-and-css-admin-dashboard). It is a one-page static website created using HTML and CSS Grid. The website's layout and design were structured with CSS Grid, while Flexbox was used briefly to position some items.

This dashboard template includes a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes, making it accessible on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. The dashboard provides an organized and clean interface for managing data, with various sections displaying relevant information such as sales, user data, and website analytics.

This project helped enhance my skills in HTML, CSS, and CSS Grid, and provided valuable experience in creating a responsive website that meets modern design standards.
